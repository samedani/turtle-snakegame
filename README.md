# Snake Game  

A classic Snake game implemented in Python using the Turtle graphics library. This project showcases fundamental concepts of game development, including event handling, animations, and collision detection.  

## Features  
- **Classic Gameplay**: Control the snake to eat the food and grow longer, but avoid colliding with walls or yourself.  
- **Score Tracking**: Displays the current score in real-time.  
- **Simple Graphics**: Utilizes Python's built-in Turtle library for drawing and movement.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Language**: Python  
- **Library**: Turtle  

## How to Run  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/samedani/snake-game.git  
   ```  
2. Navigate to the project directory:  
   ```bash  
   cd snake-game  
   ```  
3. Run the game:  
   ```bash  
   python snake_game.py  
   ```  

## How to Play  
- Use arrow keys to control the snake's direction.  
- Eat the red food blocks to grow longer and increase your score.  
- Avoid running into the walls or your own tail to keep the game going.  

## Future Enhancements  
- Implement difficulty levels (e.g., faster snake movement).  
- Add sound effects for actions like eating food or game over.  
- Enhance graphics with custom sprites instead of Turtle shapes.
